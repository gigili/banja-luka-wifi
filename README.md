# Banja Luka WiFi   

Banja Luka WiFi is an application which contains wifi passwords from all around the city of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina.      
      
The options included in the app are:      
* List of networks available offline on your device*       
* Map with the location of each added network      
* Adding new network      
* Editing an existing network      
      
*\*NOTE: the application requires network connection to be able to download all the information on the first run and later on to be able to update the same networks information. But once downloaded the networks will be available offline*
